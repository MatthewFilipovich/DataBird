# DataBird

**Winner of the Deloitte Prize at QHacks 2019**

DataBird gives social media users access to analytic and machine learning tools that utilize Google’s Natural Language API and IBM Watson’s ToneAnalyzer API to offer meaningful insights regarding their sleep trends, daily moods, frequently discussed topics, and phone usage. The goal of the project was to empower users by providing them with the ability to investigate and analyze vast amounts of personal data which could prompt substantial changes in their daily routine to improve their quality of life.
